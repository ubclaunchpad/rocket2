Rocket 2 is a from-the-ground-up rewrite of the `original Rocket <https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket>`_,
and it is a Slack bot that aims to be a ChatOps-style tool for team management
across platforms like GitHub and Google Drive, with extensive configuration
options so that it can be used by other organizations as well. Rocket 2 is used,
built, and maintained with ❤️ by `UBC Launch Pad <https://ubclaunchpad.com>`_,
UBC's student-run software engineering club.
