Rocket 2 is a from-the-ground-up rewrite of the `original Rocket`_,
and it is a Slack bot that aims to be a ChatOps-style tool for team management
across platforms like GitHub and Google Drive, with extensive configuration
options so that it can be used by other organizations as well. Rocket 2 is used,
built, and maintained with ❤️ by `UBC Launch Pad`_, UBC's student-run software
engineering club.
