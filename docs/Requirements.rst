Requirements
============

MVP
---

Our MVP is essentially feature-parity with the original Rocket. In
particular, we should have:

-  An extensible Unix-style command system
-  ``user`` command (member info)
-  ``team`` command (team management)
-  ``help`` command
-  Permissions system

All of these should be connected to a database, likely a cloud database
like DynamoDb or Firebase.

We have decided *not* to pursue a full plugin-oriented architecture, as
this would severely complicate our work and most likely would not be
used.

Stretch Goals
-------------

-  Currently Rocket does most of the work of managing the Launch Pad
   Github organization. Replicating and extending this behaviour would
   be our first priority after completing the MVP.
-  More ways to access Rocket-the-service would be nice. In particular,
   a command-line interface should be relatively easy to build. A
   web-based dashboard would be useful, but likely too far outside
   scope.
-  A reminders command has been specifically requested by the
   co-presidents.
-  The co-presidents also have other feature requests that will be added
   as Github issues.

Non-functional & Other Requirements
-----------------------------------

-  Rocket 2.0 will be containerized via
   `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`__.
-  All code will follow the `PEP8 style guide <http://pep8.org>`__; this
   will be automated with
   `pycodestyle <https://github.com/pycqa/pycodestyle>`__.
-  There should be automated tests for most behaviour, run with a CI
   system, and code coverage should be collected and uploaded to
   `Codecov.io <https://codecov.io>`__.
-  The command system should be reasonably extensible.
