Rocket 2.0 is a from-the-ground-up rebuild of [Rocket](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket),
UBC Launch Pad's in-house management Slack bot.

## Developer Installation

We use [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for dependency management.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket2.0.git
cd rocket2.0/
pip install pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

`pipenv` will manage a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/),
so interacting with the program or using the development tools has to be done
through pipenv, like so:

```bash
pipenv run pycodestyle .
```

This can get inconvenient, so you can instead create a shell that runs in the managed
environment like so:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

and then commands like `pycodestyle` and `pytest` can be run like normal.

Additionally, we use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ubclaunchpad/rocket2.0) as
a CI system. To run the same checks locally, we provide `scripts/build_check.sh`;
this can be run with:

```bash
./scripts/build_check.sh
```

You can also install it as a
[pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) for git:

```bash
cd scripts/
make install
```
