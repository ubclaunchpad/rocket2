Contributing
============

This document contains important details for anyone contributing to
Rocket 2.

Opening an Issue
----------------

If you see a bug or have a feature request, please `open an
issue <https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket2/issues>`__! That being
said, make sure to do a quick search first - there may already be an
issue that covers it.

When creating a new issue, please add a label describing the issue; the
most relevant are probably “Bug” and “Feature request”.

**If you are going to work on an issue, please assign yourself to it,
and unassign yourself if you stop working on it.**

If you are not planning to work on a new issue, please also add it to
the Rocket 2.0 project; this will automatically add it to our Kanban
board’s backlog, where we can review it in a future sprint.

Setting up branches
-------------------

Before you make any changes, you should first set up your own branch. It
is common convention to name your branch:

::

   <username>/#<issue-number>-<description-of-fix>

So if your issue is `#153 Read from
configuration <https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket2/issues/153>`__,
you would name it ``rwblickhan/#153-read-from-config``. The name needs
to be concise, descriptive, and, well, have your name and number, so to
speak.

Before-Pull-Request checklist
-----------------------------

-  All tests and style and docs checks pass (``scripts/build_check.sh``)
-  The Github build passes (Github will build your commit when you push
   it)
-  Your code is presentable and you have **not** committed extra files
   (think your credentials, IDE config files, cached directories, build
   directories, etc.)
-  You’ve written unit tests for the changes you’ve made, and that they
   cover all the code you wrote (or effectively all, given the
   circumstances)

We use ``codecov`` to check code coverage, but you can easily check the
code coverage using the ``scripts/build_check.sh`` script. The coverage
should be displayed after the unit tests are run.

Submitting a Pull Request
-------------------------

We appreciate pull requests of any size or scope.

Please use a clear, descriptive title for your pull request and fill out
the pull request template with as much detail as you can. In particular,
all pull requests should be linked to one or more issues - if a relevant
issue does not exist, please create one as described above.

All pull requests must be code reviewed. Currently the code is owned by
the
`brussel-sprouts <https://github.com/orgs/ubclaunchpad/teams/brussel-sprouts>`__
team at UBC Launch Pad; at least one member of the team must approve the
pull request before it can be merged.

All pull requests must pass our Github build before they can be merged.
The Github build checks for:

-  Passing unit tests (via `pytest <https://pytest.org>`__)
-  Minimum code coverage of unit tests (via
   `Codecov.io <https://codecov.io/>`__)
-  Code linting (via
   `flake8 <https://flake8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__)
-  PEP8 code style (via
   `pycodestyle <http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`__)
-  Correctly-formatted docstrings (via
   `pydocstyle <http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/2.1.1/>`__)
-  Correctly-formatted Markdown documentation (via
   `mdl <https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint>`__)

All of these checks are conveniently done using the
``scripts/build_check.sh`` as mentioned above.

Remember to add the label ``Ready for Review``.

After your pull request has been approved and the Github build passes,
it can be merged into ``master``. Please do so with an ordinary merge
commit, not a rebase or squash merge.

Work in progress (WIP) pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, it may be more appropriate to submit a pull request that you
are working on, just to say that you are working on something (or so
that you can get some initial feedback on your work). In that case, it
can be a good idea to submit a pull request marked WIP. The convention
here is to prepend ``[WIP]`` in the title of the request, and to further
mark it with the label ``WIP``.

Updating an Outdated Pull Request
---------------------------------

If changes have been merged between when you started work on your branch
and when your pull request was approved, you will have to update your
branch. The preferred way to do so is with a rebase.

Assuming you are on your working branch:

.. code:: bash

   git pull origin master
   git rebase master

If you have changed files that were also changed in the intervening
merge, ``git rebase`` may report merge conflicts. If this happens, don’t
panic! Use ``git status`` and ``git diff`` to determine which files
conflict and where, use an editor to fix the conflicts, then stage the
formerly-conflicting files with ``git add FILE``. Finally, use
``git rebase --continue`` to apply the fix and continue rebasing. Note
that you may have to fix conflicts multiple times in a single rebase.

It is also a good idea to replace the label ``Ready for Review`` with
``Ready for Re-Review`` for clarity.
